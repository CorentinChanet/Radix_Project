## Description

We developed a program for Radix. The purpose of this project it's to use AI to help the recruitment. The AI will make the process more faster and easier.
Examples: You need a specific employees working as engineer. The AI will passe every Resume he has.. and will show a Resume who looks the most as the one you need. 

Also we use the Dataset from Kaagle. 
Here you can Download the PDF and DOCX files : https://github.com/arefinnomi/curriculum_vitae_data 

Below you find the whole explanation, from the installation up to a glance behind the scenes.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Misterkadrix/Radix_Project.git
``` 
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install [required library]
```

## Usage
To start the program, you just need to go to the terminal and write this :
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```



## Output

There is three part:
1. Information Extraction : It will extract the data from the resume as the Name,Emailn,etc..
2. Resume Matching : It will make a match between the Resume we provide and the ones we got on our dataset
3. Resume Mathcing : It will make a match between the Resume you provide (by a uploading way) and the ones we got on our dataset



## How it works




## Examples
**Extraction Information**
<img width = '2000' scr = ''>

**Resume Matching**
<img width = '2000' scr = ''>


**Resume Matching with upload file**
<img width = '2000' scr = ''>
